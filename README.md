AWS DeepRacer code - Minimum Curvature Maximum Speed

In this repo my asset code is stored. Asset code was used to train the deepracer.

# Licence

If you base on my asset, kindly share my name and Github link :)

# Physical explanaition

In the reward function, we want to get maximum speed (fast braking and acceleration) and we want to have the track of DeepRacer to be as close as possible to a line. This is actually described in the approach name. Minimum Curvature, maximum speed.
